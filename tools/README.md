# How to describe your finite automata:
- First string — n (number of vectices) and m (number of sequences).
- Then m strings — sequences of tuples (int, int, string) — indexes of vertices and letter on edge between them.
- Then integer k, and k indexes of terminate vertices in random order.    
- Last number — index of starting vertice.
